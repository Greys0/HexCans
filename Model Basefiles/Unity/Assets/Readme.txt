This Unity project and scene contain the basic form parts of HexCans ready to be reprocessed into .mu files If you wish to make a custom HexCan style part that does not use the original model set you can either duplicate a similar part and replace it's assets, or duplicate xBasePartTools and fill it in yourself.

It's important to note that due to my own inexperience and some complexities of my workflow, most of the models I use are not properly centered and you can see in this Project that I have corrected them here, because this is the step where it's easiest to do so.

Another important thing to note is that radial decouplers will always apply the ejection force along the X axis in a positive direction, so they must face in the same direction as the red arrow when you select the topmost parent in the Hierarchy, or they will eject at strange angles. I mean, unless you want that...

It is the intent of the HexCan project to make a lightweight model/texture set for radially attachable
resource containers able to fit diverse needs while still looking kinda nice. It is being released under
CC-BY 3.0 license with the express intent that any person may take the models and apply customized
textures and cfgs to create a variant that fits their need, as well as being free to distribute the result.
We desire that any derivative works be released under the same license, but it is not mandatory.


Rules of Attribution:______________________
The creator of this part set, Greys, must remain present in the Author field in .cfg files of all derivitive works which use assets from this pack.
Other names in the field and the order they appear are up to the author of such derivitive works.

Rules of Redistribution:___________________
You are free to include as much of the base HexCans set alongside your add-on as you like with two conditions:

1. Do not distribute the original part set without modification.
If you'd like to make modified variants of the stock parts that is fine, either as part of a greater add-on or a derivative HexCans set, but do not distribute the original parts as is. This is to prevent unnecessary confusion from the users and prevent the circulation of outdated assets.

2. Try to include only the assets that you need for your add-on
Limiting the HexCan assets that are distributed alongside your add-on to those that are necessary has three main benefits: 
It reduces your distribution size which means players have to download less
It eliminates unused assets which KSP will still load, reducing player's memory load if they don't choose to install the main set (marginally)
It helps to prevent conflicts with the main set if assets have changed between your version and mine.
